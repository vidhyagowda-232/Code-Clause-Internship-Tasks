# CodeClause_Credit Card Fraud Detection
Credit card fraud is a significant problem in the financial industry, and detecting fraudulent transactions can be a daunting task. This repository aims to provide an effective solution to this problem using machine learning models and artificial neural networks.

This repository contains Python code that can help detect fraudulent transactions using various ML models and artificial neural networks. The code has been tested on a publicly available dataset containing credit card transactions, and the results have been quite promising.

Different ML models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks have been implemnted to classify transactions as genuine or fraudulent. We have used metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of the models.
